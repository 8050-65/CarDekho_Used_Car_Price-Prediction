CarDekho Used Car Price Prediction-Vehicle_Resale_Price_Prediction 
The primary objective of is project is to create a data science solution for predicting used car prices accurately by analyzing a diverse dataset including car model, no. of owners, age, mileage, fuel type, kilometers driven, features and location. The aim is to build a machine learning model that offers users to find current valuations for used cars.

Data Understanding
The Dataset contains multiple excel files, each represents its city, columns in each excel gives you an overview of each car, its details, specification and available features.
